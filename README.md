# Regularization and Model Evaluation

This project implements linear regression with non-linear basis functions, 
explores the bias-variance tradeoff using multiple fits, and applies 
L1 and L2 regularization with cross-validation to analyze their effect on loss. 
All algorithms are written in Python.
